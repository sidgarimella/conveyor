## Conveyor

A set of tools that allows Jupyter notebook cell outputs to be computed and used in other notebooks and scripts. 

##### Use Cases

 - Split ordered steps across multiple notebooks, picking up the most recent state information with each new notebook
 - Prototype and organize workflows entirely in Jupyter notebooks without having to manage script exports
 - Improve performance by reducing overheads from notebook servers and unused code cells
